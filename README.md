## Features

- **Screen Capture**: Take screenshots of specific displays or applications
- **Application-Specific Screenshots**: Capture screenshots of specific application windows
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Extract text from screenshots or existing images
- **Desktop Storage**: All screenshots are saved to a "Screenshots" folder on your Desktop
- **Multi-format Support**: Support for PNG and JPG image formats
- **Multi-language OCR**: Support for multiple languages in text recognition
- **Application Discovery**: List running applications available for capture

## Tools Available

### `capture_screen`

Captures a screenshot of the entire screen or a specific display.

**Parameters:**

- `display` (number, optional): Display number to capture (0 for primary display)
- `format` (string, optional): Image format for the screenshot ('png' or 'jpg')

### `capture_application_screen`

Captures a screenshot of a specific application window.

**Parameters:**

- `applicationName` (string, required): Name of the application to capture (e.g., 'Safari', 'Chrome', 'Finder')
- `format` (string, optional): Image format ('png' or 'jpg')

### `list_applications`

**Parameters:** None

### `extract_text`

Extracts text from an existing image file using OCR.

**Parameters:**

### `capture_screen_and_extract_text`

Captures a screenshot and extracts text from it in one operation. This is a convenience tool that combines screen capture and OCR and can work with both full screen and application-specific capture.

**Parameters:**

- `display` (number, optional): Display number to capture (0 for primary display) - ignored if applicationName is provided
- `language` (string, optional): Language for OCR recognition (e.g., "eng", "spa", "fra")
